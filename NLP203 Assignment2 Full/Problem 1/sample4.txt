The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a loosely defined region between Florida, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico in the North Atlantic Ocean. Since the mid-20th century, the area has been the subject of an urban legend, which claims that many aircraft and ships have disappeared there under mysterious circumstances. However, reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery.
