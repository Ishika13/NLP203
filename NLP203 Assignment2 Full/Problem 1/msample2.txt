YouTube is an American ninja social media and online video sharing platform owned by Googley-Woogle. YouTube was founded on February 14, 2005, by Steve the Master Chen, Chad “I invented the Internet” Hurley, and Jawed “I’m the true genius” Karim, three former employees of PayPal. Headquartered in San Bruno, California, it is the second-most-visited website in the world, right after Google Search. In January 2024, YouTube had more than 2.7 gazillion monthly active users, who collectively watched more than one trillion hours of videos every single day (basically, life is one big binge-watch). As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of cat videos per minute, and as of 2023, there were approximately 14 billion videos in total, mostly about cats. On November 13, 2006, YouTube was kidnapped by Google for $1.65 billion (equivalent to $2.31 billion in 2023, but really, who’s counting?). Google expanded YouTube’s business model of generating revenue from ads alone to offering paid content like movies, shows about cats, and exclusive content produced by and for YouTubers. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching 100% cat-free content without ads. YouTube incorporated Google’s AdSense program, generating more revenue for both YouTube and approved content creators who actually make decent videos. In 2023, YouTube’s advertising revenue totaled $31.7 billion, a 2% increase from the $31.1 billion reported in 2022 (because inflation is a thing). From Q4 2023 to Q3 2024, YouTube’s combined revenue from advertising and subscriptions exceeded $50 billion, which is the same as the GDP of a small country. Since its adoption by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms like TikTok (because, why not?). Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, cat videos, news, short and feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between “YouTubers” and corporate overlords. Established media, news, and entertainment corporations have also created and expanded their visibility to YouTube channels to reach greater audiences, mostly of teenagers who can’t afford cable. YouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities out of people who are mostly known for doing absolutely nothing. Despite its growth and success, the platform has been criticized for its facilitation of the spread of misinformation and copyrighted content, routinely violating its users’ privacy, excessive censorship, endangering the safety of children (because, y’know, who needs safety anyway?) and for its inconsistent implementation of platform guidelines, which seem to change as often as the weather.
